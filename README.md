# [Jaringan Komputer]-Programming-Tasks
In the fourth semester, students of the Information Systems program at Institut Teknologi Del are taking a course called "Jaringan Komputer" This course provides lessons on how computers can connect with each other. This time, we were given a task to put this into practice by creating a simple program in Java that uses sockets to establish connections between one computer and another, acting as both client and server.
